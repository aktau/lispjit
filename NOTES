instructions
============
- PSHUFD is for integers, SHUFPS is for floats:
  http://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=13102, also PSHUFD seems to be
  the only instruction that can take 4 words from the same register and
  shuffle them. Seems a bit strange but a poster says that...
- MOVD is for integers, MOVSS is for floats, although they can technically
  be used for both. It's a pipeline thing.

  register](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2231694/storing-two-x86-32-bit-registers-into-128-bit-xmm-register)
- To see some of the crazy stuff that the JIT is generating, run `gobjdump
  -D -b binary -mi386 -Mx86-64 /tmp/jitcode`

special swizzles
----------------

Some shuffles/swizzles get a special instruction, as noted:

calling a function
==================

On x86-32, you can supply the function pointer as an immediate:

```asm
call &getchar
```

On x86-64, you have to move the 64-bit pointer into place first:

```asm
mov64 rax, (uintptr_t) getchar
call rax
```
